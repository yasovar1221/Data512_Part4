# Wildfire Analysis: New Haven

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook analyzes the impact of wildfire activity on New Haven, Connecticut, focusing on:
1. Air quality trends using PM2.5 data.
2. Economic disruptions across industries, with a particular emphasis on manufacturing and state government interventions.
3. Statistical modeling to quantify relationships between wildfire activity, air quality, and economic outcomes.

The analysis integrates data from multiple sources to produce actionable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in New Haven.

## Key Features
- **Wildfire Impact Score Calculation**: Combines PM2.5 levels, wildfire size, and proximity to quantify the effects of wildfire activity on New Haven.
- **Air Quality Analysis**: Visualizations and metrics to explore PM2.5 trends during high wildfire activity periods.
- **Economic Impact Assessment**: Linear regression models to assess disruptions in industry facilities ("Units") and total wages across sectors.
- **Actionable Insights**: Recommendations for fire-resistant infrastructure and proactive state measures based on findings.

## Data Sources
The notebook integrates datasets from the following sources:
1. **Wildfire Data** ([ScienceBase](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/61aa537dd34eb622f699df81)):
   - Covers wildfire incidents within 650 miles of New Haven, including size and proximity data.
2. **Air Index Data** ([EPA AQS API](https://www.epa.gov/aqs)):
   - PM2.5 concentration data to assess smoke exposure and air quality trends.
3. **Economic Data** ([Connecticut Department of Labor](https://www1.ctdol.state.ct.us/lmi/202/202_annualaverage.asp)):
   - Annual average employment, wages, and facility counts by industry.

## Results Summary
### Key Findings:
- **Air Quality:** PM2.5 levels correlate strongly with wildfire proximity, peaking during summer months.
- **Economic Impact:** Manufacturing experienced significant disruptions, with a reduction of 8.5 facilities during high-impact years.
- **State Government Spending:** Increased by $51 million in response to wildfire-related challenges.

### Recommendations:
1. **Enhance Fire Protection:** Equip manufacturing facilities with fire-resistant infrastructure.
2. **Proactive State Measures:** Invest in wildfire prevention and emergency management.
3. **Monitoring Systems:** Deploy real-time air quality alerts for residents and industries.
